Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM

JDK is a super set of JRE which contains the JRE along with compiler , hence it can be used for development purposes.
JRE contains JVM and other run time libraries required to execute the program.
  It does not contain other development tools like compiler,debugger etc.
  Hence we can install JRE only to run the Java applications not to develop them.
JVM cannot be installed as it does not have any physical existence.
  It comes with JRE and JDK installation.
  It provides platform independence by converting the bytecode obtained from any machine into corresponding machine instructions,
    but it is created only when we execute the java program.
